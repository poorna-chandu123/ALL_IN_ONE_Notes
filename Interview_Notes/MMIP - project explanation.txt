**Project Title:** Medicaid Management Insurance Process (MMIP)

In my final year of MCA, I developed a web application called Medicaid Management Insurance Process (MMIP). This project focused on managing health insurance processes, including creating APIs and Rest APIs for claims authentication and procedure code management. Each part of the human body has a specific procedure code that is crucial during claims submission and authentication. These APIs are used in various modules and services for reference.

The MMIP system is essential for the efficient administration of the Medicaid program, adapting to new regulations, healthcare reforms, and changing needs of Medicaid members. It ensures that individual medical records are accurately maintained and complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for secure patient information handling.

**Modules:**

1. Administration
2. Provider
3. Client
4. Claims
5. Reference
6. Authorization
